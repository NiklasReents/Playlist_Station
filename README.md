# Playlist Station (w.i.p.)

This React-based app enables users to register, log in, change their passwords via email and create their own custom playlists.

Tech stack frontend: React/JS, CSS.
Teck stack backend: Node.js with Express and various npm modules (i.e. jwt, formidable, nodemailer, mongoose...) plus Mongo Atlas database.

## To Do/Current Issues

- implement CSS stylesheets
- enable playlist modes (i.e. shuffle, list)
- make it possible to modify/delete lists and users profiles
- give users the option to create custom themes for app body and background
