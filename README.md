# Playlist Station (w.i.p.)

This React-based app enables users to register, log in, change their passwords via email and, most importantly, create their own custom playlists!

Tech stack frontend: React/JS, CSS.
Teck stack backend: Node.js with Express and various npm modules (i.e. jwt, formidable, nodemailer, mongoose...) plus Mongo Atlas database.

## To Do/Current Issues

- enable playlist modes (i.e. shuffle, list; I will most likely create a separate song module to make this possible (the current audio implementation is experimental))
- make it possible to modify/delete lists and users profiles
- bonus: give users the option to create custom themes for app body and background
